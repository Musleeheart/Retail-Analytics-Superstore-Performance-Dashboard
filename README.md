# Employee Insights and Attrition Analysis

## Project Description
#### This project presents a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard designed to provide actionable insights into workforce demographics, employee satisfaction, compensation, and attrition trends. Built with Power BI, the dashboard enables HR professionals and organizational leaders to explore key metrics such as employee distribution by department, gender, and job role, average income levels, satisfaction scores, and attrition rates across job levels. By combining interactive filters and dynamic visualizations, the dashboard helps uncover patterns in employee behavior and organizational performance. These insights support data-driven decision-making, allowing HR teams to identify areas of concern, improve employee retention strategies, and enhance overall workforce management.

## Aim
#### To design a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard that provides actionable insights into workforce demographics, employee satisfaction, compensation, and attrition trends. The dashboard empowers HR professionals and organizational leaders to make data-driven decisions that improve employee retention, optimize workforce management, and enhance overall organizational performance.


## Processes
#### 1. Data Cleaning
- Tool Used: Power Query (Power BI)
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values
- Ensured consistency across all sheets
- Validated data types and standardised formats

#### 2. Data Analysis
- Compared categories to identify workforce trends
- Calculated key metrics such as attrition rate, average hourly pay, and average monthly pay using DAX
- Explored relationships between attrition rate, job role, and job level
- Analysed income distribution across different job roles

#### 3. Dashboard Creation
- Designed interactive visuals in Power BI
- Implemented slicers for dynamic filtering by age group, gender, department, job level, and performance rating
- Used bar charts, column charts, and pie charts to compare categories and highlight proportions
  
#### 4. Insight Summarisation
- The Research & Development department has the largest workforce and ranks as the second-highest earning group, after managers.
- Analysis of monthly income vs. monthly rate shows that employees at Job Level 2 tend to earn higher monthly incomes compared to other levels. This may indicate longer working hours or more days worked at that level. Meanwhile, monthly rates increase progressively with higher job levels.
- The overall attrition rate is 16%, concentrated mainly at entry-level positions (Levels 1 and 2). Attrition is most common among roles such as lab technicians, sales representatives, and research scientists, which may be linked to their relatively lower income levels.
- The organization employs more females (60%) than males (40%), yet male employees tend to earn slightly higher average incomes compared to their female counterparts.

## Recommendation
- Address Attrition at Entry-Level Roles
- Develop targeted retention programs for lab technicians, sales representatives, and research scientists, where attrition is highest.
- Investigate why Job Level 2 employees earn higher monthly incomes compared to other levels, and ensure pay structures align with workload and responsibilities.
- Conduct a pay equity analysis to address the observed gender income gap and promote fairness across roles.
- Focus on improving environmental satisfaction scores, especially for employees rating lower (scores 1–2).
- Implement workplace wellness programs, flexible work arrangements, and recognition initiatives to boost morale.
- Since Research & Development has the largest workforce and strong earning potential, invest in training and innovation programs to maximize productivity.
- Balance resources across departments to ensure smaller teams (e.g., HR) are not overlooked in workforce planning.
- Track attrition trends over time to determine whether rates are progressing or declining, and identify if turnover is concentrated among underperformers or high-potential employees.
- Use predictive analytics to anticipate future attrition risks and proactively intervene.


## Design Choice 
- Color Scheme: Used a clean white background with maroon accents to maintain a professional look while ensuring readability and visual appeal.
- Chart Selection:
    - Bar/Column Charts → for comparing employee counts across departments, job roles, and job levels.
    - Pie Charts → for showing proportions such as gender distribution.
    - Line Charts → for visualising trends over time, such as income progression across job levels.
    - Slicers → to enable interactive filtering by age group, gender, department, job level, and performance rating, allowing users to drill down into specific workforce segments.
- Clarity & Accessibility: Focused on simplicity and intuitive design so HR professionals can quickly interpret insights without being overwhelmed by complex visuals.
